#### What is computational linguistics?

Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Traditionally, computational linguistics was usually performed by computer scientists who had specialized in the application of computers to the processing of a natural language. CL belongs to the research of Artificial Intelligence and interface between linguistics and information technology.


### What is an Unconference (Barcamp)?

An unconference is and open participatory workshop/event where the content is provided by the participants.
