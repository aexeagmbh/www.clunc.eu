### clunc [klʌŋk]: 

The same old message all over again: „There are no jobs for computational linguists outside of  the university campus!“

aexeas CLs are the perfect proof of the opposite. 

We are happy to invite you to our second Computational linguistics unconference – clunc – taking place on January 23 and 24 in Stuttgart, Germany. Open to experts, students, auto didacts – come and enjoy the creative exchange about innovations and experience, gain insights into the latest concepts, network and establish new relationships. 


### What's new?

This time, a software hackathon will take playe at clunc. Within 30 hours, a software-based solution for a computational linguistics challenge is to be developed. 
A Jury is going to decide, who will win the 1.000 € prize money. The team of the second most promising solution can look forward to 500€.

#### What is computational linguistics?

Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Traditionally, computational linguistics was usually performed by computer scientists who had specialized in the application of computers to the processing of a natural language. CL belongs to the research of Artificial Intelligence and interface between linguistics and information technology.


### What is an Unconference (Barcamp)?

An unconference is and open participatory workshop/event where the content is provided by the participants.
