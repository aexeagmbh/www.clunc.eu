### clunc [klʌŋk]: 

The evolution of processing power as well as the intelligence that can be put into algorithms opens up new perspectives for the content generation industry – this is one of the answers of Big Data. Were as the bottleneck for content used to be people and time, it now is algorithms and (structured) data and with it the professional shift of editors, computational linguists and similar.
Whereas editors need to think about competences like programming and structuring data, computational linguists now have perspectives in the free economy outside of the university campus.

We are happy to invite everyone interested to our third computational linguistics unconference – clunc – taking place on March 11th and 12th in Stuttgart, Germany. Open to experts, students, auto didacts – come and enjoy the creative exchange about innovations and experience, gain insights into the latest concepts, network and establish new relationships.

### What is computational linguistics?

Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Traditionally, computational linguistics was usually performed by computer scientists who had specialized in the application of computers to the processing of a natural language.
