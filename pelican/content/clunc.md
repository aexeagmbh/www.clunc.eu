### clunc [klʌŋk]: 

The evolution of processing power as well as the intelligence that can be put into algorithms opens up new perspectives for the content generation industry – this is one of the answers of Big Data. People and time used to  be the bottleneck for content generation, but now it is algorithms and (structured) data, as well as the professional shift of experts like editors and computational linguists.
Editors need to think about competences like programming and structuring data, but computational linguists now have real perspectives in the free economy outside of the university campus.


We are happy to invite everyone interested to our third computational linguistics unconference – clunc – taking place March 11th and 12th in Stuttgart, Germany. Open to experts, students, autodidacts – come and enjoy the creative exchange of innovations and experience, gain insights into the latest concepts, network and establish new relationships.

### What is computational linguistics?

Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Traditionally, computational linguistics was usually performed by computer scientists who had specialized in the application of computers to the processing of a natural language. CL belongs to the research of Artificial Intelligence and interface between linguistics and information technology.
